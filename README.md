To replicate the results in this article you will need to request the
geocode data for NLSY from the BLS. Instructions for this process are
available [here](https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsgeo97.htm)

To replicate the tables in the paper and online appendix:

Place Location_R15.csv from NLSY97 restricted data in the ./data subdirectory.
Run the geocode.R script in R.
Run the iv_estimation_vol.do in Stata to replicate the volunteering
and donation results.
Run the iv_estimation_vote_vep.do in Stata to replicate the voting
results.
